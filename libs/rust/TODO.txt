We should have rust libs here (without a version in the file name for lock-step upgrade), and not use cargo for builds.

You can't just rename jni-ab34cd28ff4.rlib to jni.rlib though as cargo/rustc place the same version string in a blog within.

Google must've "vendored" Rust deps into their Piper VCS system.
